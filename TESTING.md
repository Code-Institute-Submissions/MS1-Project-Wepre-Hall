## Fixed Bugs

- Burger icon drop down menu did not appear, to fix I found the answer on stack overflow and copied the code from there - I had to add some javascript to the pages this is mentioned in a comment above the code itself.

- Footer links were underlined, to fix I added a css class and set: `text-decoration: none;`

- Carousel had white space either side, to fix I found the answer on stack overflow and added `img-responsive` bootstrap class to carousel HTML.

- Embedded maps wasnt responsive in all views, to fix I found the answer on OS training website and copied there `map-responsive` css classes.

- When testing in Devtools I found in the galaxy fold view the content text on the home page was encroaching into the footer, I found the problem was because I had added a height to the class for the content and that was stopping the bootstrap grid system from working. So to fix I removed the height property.

- Failed HTML W3 validator because I had the hero image as a section element with no headings, to fix changed it to an aside element.

- When testing in Devtools, ipad pro view had whitespace below the footer on index.html and contact.html, to fix this I add media queries for the ipad pro view size and added a `min-height`.

- Deleted websitemanifest file and links to it as it was causing an error in firefox. The file was copied over in the files from Realfavicongenerator.net.

## Outstanding Bugs

- CSS validatior had 2 errors both were from the bootstaps CDN so could not be changed.

## Other Issues

- During a review with my mentor he mentioned that some of the pages required alot of scrolling to the top of the page to get to the navbar to navigate and is not a very good user experience, to fix this I decided to make the navbar fixed to the top of the page by adding the bootstrap 4 class `sticky-top`.
