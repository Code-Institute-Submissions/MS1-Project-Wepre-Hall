# Wepre Hall Website

## UX

### Purpose

As a local resident and having some interest in the local history after some research of the hall online, I discovered although there are various bits of information about the hall there is no one website dedicated to the hall itself. As the hall has been demolished my aim is to create a website to prevent the history of the hall being lost to time.

### User Stories

user 1: "I would like to know about the history of Wepre hall, why was it demolished?

user 2: "What did Wepre hall look like?"

user 3: "Where was the location of the hall and what is there now?"

user 4: "What are the visitor centre opening times?"  

### Strategy

As the site owner my goal is to consolidate all the past and present information about the hall into one place and provide users with this information in as simple a format as possible.  To achieve this, I aim to:
-	Give information of the history of the hall
-	Provide details of the present-day situation
-	Show pictures of what the hall used to look like
-	Give the halls location and visitor centre opening times

The target audience for the website is:
-	Local people wanting to know more about the history of the area
-	Visitors to the area looking for places to visit

### Scope

The website requirements and key functionality will include:

-	Users should be able to see a clear timeline of the history of the hall 
-	Users should be informed concisely what is now at the site of where the hall used to be
-	Image carousel of what the hall used to look like
-	Embedded map of the location of the site
-	Users should be given the opening times of the visitor centre
-	The approach should be within my current capabilities
-	Website should provide users with a clean and easy UX
-	Users shouldn’t be overwhelmed with too much information 
-	A contact me page

### Structure

The main objective of the website is to essentially provide information to a target audience of pretty much any age group or technical ability so it needs to be structured in as linear format as possible whilst still providing adequate information to the user.

### Skeleton

The website will contain 4 pages:
-	Home:  Image carousel, brief description of history and present day
-	History: Image, timeline of Wepre hall history
-	Visit: Image, description of the site now, visitor centre location and opening times. 
-	Contact: Image and contact form for people wishing for more information

Each of the pages will include:
-	Navbar: Will navigate between the pages
-	Footer: Links to wepre park website and leaflet download

#### Tablet view

The tablet view will be the same as the desktop view.

### Surface

#### Typography

- I decided on the use of the Playfair Display, serif font family as it has a old world feel to it which will match the theme for the old historic hall well. 

#### Colour Scheme

- Taking inspiration from the nationaltrust.org.uk as they will have a similar target demographic, use of strong pastel colours for header and footer that mix well with the images of the hall. And white space in-between content to aid readability

### Features to implement later

- I would like to add functionality to the form so that when the data is submitted it get sent somewhere, this is currently beyond my skill set.

## Difficulties Encountered
- The main problem I encountered was after deciding on building a website for Wepre Hall, I soon realised as the hall was demolished in the 1960s there was a very limited amount of pictures available and next to none of these were good enough quality. 
So I made the decision for decorative purposes I would substitute the old photographs for high quality images of similar settings. The original images of the hall and park are on the Wepre Park Wikipedia page and in the Wepre Park Leaflet and both can be found in the footer on the webpage.
